# **My first website**

This is a test site, on which I learn how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In the upcoming weeks it will hopefully become more beautiful and professional! :)

## **Website contents**

There are three sections on the site:

1. About me
2. What are my interests?
3. My favorite pictures

## **Preview**
